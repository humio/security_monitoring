# Inspired by florian roth auditD config example for linux ( https://github.com/Neo23x0/auditd) I made an similar 
# effort for the windows platform. Please read the link for nsacyber carefully as addionaly configuration 
# is needed to ensure full benefit of this configuration. 
#
# Some eventid's may not be generated unless specific non standard polices are enabled
# Some log data sources are not present on all versions of windows
#
# some log sources may only be relevant for specific types of servers
#
# addtionally this monitoring can provide a forensic and incident readiness. From experience the log data is also extremely usefull
# in day to day operations for general infrastructure monitoring. 
#
# config of sysmon and installation of sysmon must be done seperately from this config
